## Overview

**mhpfilter** splits macroeconomic time series into a trend and a cycle
with the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter and two versions whose settings
come from the data:

- [`hp_filter()`](https://myaseen208.com/mhpfilter/reference/hp_filter.md):
  the HP filter with a fixed smoothing parameter (1600 quarterly, 100
  annual);
- [`mhp_filter()`](https://myaseen208.com/mhpfilter/reference/mhp_filter.md):
  the modified HP filter of McDermott (1997), assessed by Choudhary,
  Hanif and Iqbal (2014): every series gets the smoothing parameter that
  minimises a generalised cross-validation criterion (the published
  approximation, or the exact criterion);
- [`fmhp_filter()`](https://myaseen208.com/mhpfilter/reference/fmhp_filter.md):
  the fully modified HP filter of Hanif, Iqbal and Choudhary (2017),
  which also reduces the end-point bias of the HP filter by raising the
  smoothing parameter at the first and last observations, with linear or
  quadratic weights chosen to minimise the end-point loss of Bloechl
  (2014).

Around them:

- many series at once
  ([`mhp_batch()`](https://myaseen208.com/mhpfilter/reference/mhp_batch.md),
  [`fmhp_batch()`](https://myaseen208.com/mhpfilter/reference/fmhp_batch.md)),
  the filters compared
  ([`mhp_compare()`](https://myaseen208.com/mhpfilter/reference/mhp_compare.md),
  [`batch_compare()`](https://myaseen208.com/mhpfilter/reference/mhp_compare.md),
  [`fmhp_compare()`](https://myaseen208.com/mhpfilter/reference/fmhp_compare.md));
- the weights, gain functions and end-point loss of any HP-type filter
  ([`hp_weights()`](https://myaseen208.com/mhpfilter/reference/hp_weights.md),
  [`hp_gain()`](https://myaseen208.com/mhpfilter/reference/hp_gain.md),
  [`hp_loss()`](https://myaseen208.com/mhpfilter/reference/hp_loss.md),
  [`hp_schedule()`](https://myaseen208.com/mhpfilter/reference/hp_schedule.md));
- simulated trend-plus-cycle series and the power comparison of the
  papers
  ([`mhp_designs()`](https://myaseen208.com/mhpfilter/reference/mhp_designs.md),
  [`mhp_simulate()`](https://myaseen208.com/mhpfilter/reference/mhp_simulate.md),
  [`fmhp_simulation()`](https://myaseen208.com/mhpfilter/reference/fmhp_simulation.md));
- `ggplot2` graphics, a plain-language interpretation of every result
  ([`mhp_interpret()`](https://myaseen208.com/mhpfilter/reference/mhp_interpret.md)),
  the references of every method
  ([`mhp_cite()`](https://myaseen208.com/mhpfilter/reference/mhp_cite.md))
  and an application that runs all of this without code
  ([`mhp_app()`](https://myaseen208.com/mhpfilter/reference/mhp_app.md)).

Version 1.0.0 keeps every function, argument and result of version 0.1.0
and adds the fully modified HP filter. Every filter is one banded linear
solve, so the search over 100000 values of the smoothing parameter for
200 observations takes 1.3 s instead of 6.4 s, and longer series gain
more; the fully modified HP filter reproduces the published MATLAB code,
and the end-point losses of the HP filter in Tables 3a and 3b of Hanif
et al. (2017) are reproduced.

    , k_quadratic     = NULL
    , alpha_linear    = seq(from = 0, to = 2000, by = 10)
    , alpha_quadratic = seq(from = 0, to = 2000, by = 5)
    , schemes         = c("linear", "quadratic")
